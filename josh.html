            1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        Be ready to accept new realities of life. You are transitioning from a different part of the world to a completely new place where the culture is almost completely different from where you come from. Embrace the new experiences you will have in UCU
       </p>

            2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        Most of us come to campus with very high expectations, but only a few of us achieve those expectations because academic advice is almost non-existent from where we come from. My advice is: have realistic expectations based on the new realities. Ask yourself, do I meet the requirements to get into the program/career that I am hopping to pursue?
       </p>

            3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        Try to make new friends; it could be classmates, roommates or people you meet within your campus.

            4.  From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms).  
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        Unfortunately, the honest truth is that there is no formula for success in UCU. However, always do the bare minimum: work hard in school and if possible, try to get into some internship/co-op experience while still in school.

            5. What challenges do you think hinder new South Sudanese students from succeeding in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
            Pressure to fulfill unrealistic expectations of friends and relatives back home and Feeling of loneliness.

                6.  Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage expectations from friends and family back home?­­ 
            </p>
        </strong>
        <p>
            Tell them the truth about your situation in UCU. Some will believe you and some will even not talk to you altogether. The most important thing is that, you have communicated your message by being honest.

                7. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
            </p>
        </strong>
        <P>
            My aspirations were not entirely met, but I did my best to achieve what I could. If I were to start over again, I would perhaps socialize more by getting to know as many people within my area of study. Connections matter more in UCU and life.
