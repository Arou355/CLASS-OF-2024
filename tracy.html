    1.From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students? 
</p></strong>
<P>
    While the achievement of having made it to UCU can be exciting, the transition to UCU life and culture can present a variety of challenges. Such challenges can range from cultural & social to academic difficulties. It’s very normal to experience a variety of emotions subsequent to these challenges. 

In terms of cultural and social aspects, everything will look strange and unwelcoming. In order to fit in, you will need to learn from others as much as you can. When faced with these challenges, it is tempting for some students to isolate themselves and bury their heads in books in their rooms, library or social media. Others would spent most of their time chatting with people back home  as their only contacts. While these may not be entirely wrong, they will slow down your integration and understanding of the new life in UCU. Try as much as possible to reach out to people around you.

    2.  Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage expectations from friends and family back home? ­­
</P></strong>
<P>
    Adjust your relationships to be in line with your reality. Don’t be too proud, be honest with the people you care about. Your immediate family members will likely believe you. Balance your personal ambitions with the needs of your family. Make a choice on what you need to do in the short run depending on their situation. Above all, never forget to prioritize yourself. No one will take care of you here, so you will have to put your own needs first. You can easily find yourself with mental health issues here if you neglect your own financial, academic, emotional and physical wellbeing.

    3. What challenges do you think hinder new students from succeeding in UCU?
</p></strong>
<p>
    The most important thing is approaching life in UCU with the right mindset. Humility and the maturity to be true to yourself are very important. Too often, folks get too carried away by their high school successes and the prestige of studying in UCU that they make decisions to maintain a given image. Doing what works for you is the way to go, enrolling in programs because of prestige and the need to be seen as academically capable is a sure way to set yourself up for failure. Never compare or measure yourself against others or try to outdo anyone. All careers are important in UCU, do what you like and do it really well. Your good grades will open doors to many opportunities that you can’t access if you were to take a program that you are struggling in.

    4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms). 
</p></strong>
<P>
    It takes the usual clichés; hard work, determination, focus and networking. Do not underestimate the essence of networking in a Ugandan context. As much as merit is rewarded in UCU, sometimes an element of good connection is necessary. That’s why being your best in any form of social interaction is critical because you never know what those interactions hold in the future. You could land your dream job due to a recommendation from a very unlikely source. A friend of your friend could hear nice things about you, and they could refer you to a potential employer. There exist a plenty of such examples

    5. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
</p></strong>
<P>
   I feel like if I was given re-do button, I would have pressed it a thousand times by now haha. But I feel like I have come from very far to where I am at the moment. I have worked very hard to get to where I am in life. I had a few failures, but I had a lot of achievements as well, and it is important to mold your failures and incorporate them into shaping a refined version of you. I am a firm believer in “everything in life happens for a reason”, so I wouldn’t change a thing from my past. Rather, I would create a new blueprint for what days, weeks, or years ahead will look like.
