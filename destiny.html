    <p>1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students? </p>
</strong>
<p>
    Explore, you are not the only person who might have come from a different place / country, other students have traveled distances too. Learn their values and motivation, while you pivot on your heritage. Discover UCU and her diversity (cultures, resources, people, politics, among others) whenever you get a chance.
</p>
<strong>
    <p>2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school?</p>
</strong>
<p>
    One needs a good blend of pragmatism and idealism. Depending on your circumstances, follow your dream while being mindful of the reality. Right now, data science and computer science / technology are appealing, but they may not be what make your world go merry. Some programs require an undergraduate degree as admission prerequisite, thus, patience is key. Know your situation, plan, prepare well, and do what you enjoy and may fulfill you when you stare down the barrel of your career. Nevertheless, pay attention to what is going on around you; some careers are in decline!

<strong>
    <p>3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? </p>
</strong>
<P>
    Staying in touch with your friends and colleagues you came with is a good practice because they might be facing the same challenges. By sharing experiences, you will learn how they are coping and that may ameliorate your case. Secondly, you may discuss shared experiences and that may allay the loneliness a little bit. In any case, reach out to someone and discuss the anxiety you are feeling.

        4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms). 
    </p>
</strong>
<P>
    Focus and curiosity will serve you well. You will be one of the least prepared students in your class for the first one or two years. Don’t let that deter you, instead, focus on what you want to accomplish and learn as much as you can by yourself, from your classmates, and from instructors (teaching assistants, lecturers or professors).

        5. What challenges do you think hinder new South Sudanese students from succeeding in UCU? 
    </p>
</strong>
<P>
    One of the main challenges is inflexible approach to achieving the goals. Most of the time when students arrive here, and rightly so, the predetermined goal is completion of the studies. There is nothing wrong with that in itself. However, it should be taken to the next step – what does one want to do with the education or a degree for that matter. In most cases, the common binary path is work or further studies. For the person who would like to join the workforce, the most efficient route is through a work term / internship, not necessarily graduating quicker/earlier. For the students in technical fields and for any student really, seek every opportunity to do a coop; it is what may make you stand out from the rest of recent graduates when applying for your first job.

        6.  Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage expectations from friends and family back home?­­
    </p>
</strong>
<p>
    Frequent and proper communication is key,let them know your situation. Sometimes just talk for the sake of it, it may be therapeutic to you and your loved ones back home. Adequate communication will give them something to hope for; however, when you are not in touch for whatever reason, they may fill the void with worries and other things.

        7. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in Canada?
    </p>
</strong>
<p>
    Financial freedom is a long-term journey, I think there is still plenty of time ahead for me to achieve my goals. Always put in your best work and remember that better days are ahead.
