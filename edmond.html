    1.    What inspired you to pursue  studies in Computer Science of all the academic programs that were available to you? 
</p></strong>
<p>
    Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become an integral part of the world that we live in today. Having a degree in this field will provide you with a deep understanding of theories and emerging technologies. This knowledge and experience will allow you to develop cutting-edge solutions that address today’s challenges.
</p>
<strong><p>
    2.      Would you say personal discipline and motivation are the main factors in your academic success or would you credit strong family support? Inherent intellectual aptitude goes without saying. 
</p></strong>
<p>
    There is no magic wand for success in these parts of the world. Personal discipline and decisiveness are key. You have to have a plan from the start. Know what you want, but be realistic in your pursuit. If you find yourself unmotivated at school and not sure about what you want out of your academic career, then take a break. Get out there and experience the world. Once you’ve made up your mind about what you want out of life, you can go back to school with a strategic roadmap of how to achieve your goals.

    3.      What are some of the biggest challenges you faced getting to where you are today and if any, current day-to-day challenges and setbacks?
</p></strong>
<p>
    My industry changes very rapidly. I am constantly learning to avoid my skillset becoming obsolete. Technological improvement is fast, tools change quickly. Everyone hoping for a career in software development has to keep up with industry trends and upgrade their skillset on frequent basis. 
</p>
<strong><p>
    4.      Do you have a mentor? If so, how have they helped you in your career?
</p></strong>
<p>
    I do. They have helped me understand key concepts in computer science over the years. It is much easier to talk to someone that has experience with whatever problem you are trying to solve. 
</p>
<strong><p>
    5.      What are the most vital steps someone should take to break into and succeed in your industry? 
</p></strong>
<p>
    To successfuly have a career as a software developer, one needs to be motivated to learn. Coding doesn’t come naturally to everyone, it requires hard work. One must be willing to put in long hours to properly hone and  master the craft to keep up with the industry. Most jobs will need you to have experience and be comfortable demonstrating your technical skills and experience. Therefore try to get as many internships as possible while still in school. Build your own portfolio of real projects that you’ve worked on, they help sell your skillset. No matter how good your grades will be in school, soft skills in the workplace will determine the speed of your career progression. Never neglect them, apply yourself socially and learn how to work and communicate effectively with all kinds of people.

    6. Looking back, did you envision this is where you would be when you were in high school? What do you know now that you wished you had known before you started your career? 
</p></strong>
<p>
    For the longest time, I did not envision myself as a computer programmer professionally. I never knew or appreciated the value of software development early on. Had I foreseen my current career path, I would have done more to expose myself to coding very early.

    7. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
</p></strong>
<p>
    Reach out to friends you know here and family back home, talk to members of your local committee and be open minded. Join campus activities and clubs to meet like-minded students. Seek professional counselling if your symptoms become extreme like withdrawing from friends. You could be experiencing depression. Many campuses now offer counselling services for free.
