    1.  From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students? 
</p></strong>
<P>
    Do not lose yourself trying to fit in. Have boundaries and respect them. Take care of yourself, not everyone you will meet has good intentions. 
</P>
<strong><P>
    2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school?
</P></strong>
<P>
    I think it entirely depends on what you want to achieve first, money or your passion. I would say choose a program that you are interested in and you enjoy doing. However, if you want a career that will give you money instantly then go for it. You can always come back later and study what you are passionate about.

    3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
</P></strong>
<P>
    Join Student Clubs at your school. You will find a lot of students with the same struggles as you. Exchange contacts with people you connect well with and make sure you keep in touch. They will be your besties by the end of your program. At the very least, you wouldn’t just be going to school to attend classes but to also meet friends.

    4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in Canada? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms).  

</P></strong>
<P>
    I have not succeeded yet, but it takes so much self discipline to achieve anything in this country. Unlike high school where we competed and were pushed to succeed, this place is the total opposite. Everything is up to you. If you don’t do your assignments, that’s your problem, not one will yell at you. You will need to set goals that will remind you why you are in school in the first place. If you lack a firm conviction, a good reason reason to succeed at school, then you will easily find yourself dropping out. Life in UCU can be an hamster wheel, an unending loop. I can’t speak about this from a professional level because I am still a student.

<strong><p>
    5. Do you have a mentor? If so, how have they helped you in your academic or professional career so far?
</p></strong>
    <p>
        Yes, I have had different mentors at different stages of my life. My current mentor was a major influence in my decision to pursue Computer Science. This individual studied the same program and was a scientist for many years before retiring. I was unsure of the career path I wanted to pursue once, I graduated high school. My mentor recommended a Tech degree because of its versatility across a wide variety of industries. 
    </p>
   <strong><p>
    6. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
</p></strong>
<p>
    I would get more involved socially. I am a very conservative person, I find it hard to socialize with people with different principles and lifestyles. I do realize diversity is important, so I try everyday to expose myself to different experiences.
