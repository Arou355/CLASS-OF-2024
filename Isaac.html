    <strong><p>1.What inspired you to pursue your studies in Computer science
        of all the academic programs that were availabe to you
    </p></strong>
    <p>i see a huge perspective in the field. The technology keeps eveolving, with robotics
        and AI playing the prime in recent years. But i think we are far from the end, and the demand 
        for motivated computer scientists will only continue to grow. This cannot be said about many other 
        jobs with uncetain future.RObots will will replace humans in certain professions, but it won't be
        the case with people who design and progrma these robots.
     </p>
     <strong><p>2.Do you have any advice to new students
         joining post-secondary insitutions on 
         choosing academic programs and careers for 
         success after school?
     </p></strong>
     <p>I would encourage them to pursue
         academic programs or careers they are passionate about
         don't select a program because of prestige and status,
         additionally all the academic programs or careers
        are within reach and possible to achieve, so go after your dreams!
     </p>
     <strong><p>3.What challenges do you think hinder
         new international students from succeding
         in UCU?
     </p></strong>
     <P>One of the challenes that hinder new international 
         students from succedingin UCU is failure to seek help
         and guidence from friends ,classmates,and academic advisors.
         Reach out whenever you can instead of trying to figure 
         out everything on your own
     </P>
     <strong><p>4.How can new international students cope with
         loneliness and feeling out of place when they
         first arrive in UCU?
     </p></strong>
     <P>New international stuents can cope with loneliness
         and feeling out of place by reaching out to former students
         and current students who might have gone through a similar experiences
         don't be afaid to ask and get involved in ISA events.
         call home whenever you can
         </P>
        
    <strong><p>5.Do you have a mentor? if so, how
        have they helped you?
    </p></strong>
    <p>Yes international students alumni
        and graduate students provided me with so much guidance 
        and helped me as a freshman. they helped me by sharing 
        their their study habits and time management skills.
        They also emphasized on the impotance of keeping up the 
        lecturss and the assignment, this assisted me to finish 
        my assignments on time and never missed a deadline.
    </p>
    <strong><p>6. From your experience so far what does
        it take to succeed in UCU
        (Measuring success in academic terms)
    </p></strong>
    <p>To succeed IN UCU in academics from my own 
        experience requires persistence and determination.
        You can always retake a failed class if you 
        are determined to achieve your aademic goals
        Additionally, the support from your parents,
        friends and the community thousands of miles away rooting 
        for you also influenced the desire to succeed.
        You did not come tjis far to fail they would encourage.
    </p>
   <strong><p>7.Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage
       expectations from friends and family back home?
   </p></strong>
   <p>.New students can manage expectatons 
       from friends and family back home by knowing 
       and acknowleding what is outside their abilities 
       and what they are capable of
       self-awareness is key in managing high expectations.
       know what you can and cannot do and be honest about it.
