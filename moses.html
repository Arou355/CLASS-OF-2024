            1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p> Once you are here, focus on your studies especially in your first year, you will have fun later if you want to. Establish yourself by having a good GPA to get/maintain the program of your choice. Seek help, ask for advice and never give up. You are not alone.  We all in it together.</p>

            2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>Yes absolutely! Be unique, don’t do something because other people are doing it. Do what you love and something that you can earn skills in. It’s all about what marketable skills you have over here in UCU, not just holding a degree. </p>

            3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        This is terrible… Trust me it was difficult for me but hold on, you are an adult now. Always keep yourself busy; chat with your friends, watch movies, listen to music and make books your friends as well.

            4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        Life is not easy anywhere, you just need to keep going and work smart, have a strategy, get external advises and always weigh your options properly before making a big decision.

            5. What challenges do you think hinder new South Sudanese students from succeeding in UCU?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>I think the transition and many factors such as environment, education system, foods, types of friends and individual mindsets contribute to one’s success or failure. Don’t be afraid of change. Be open minded and try to cancel all the distractions that come your way and try to focus on your goals. </p>

            6. Were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        Oops still working on my aspirations. If I were to start over, I would have made books my friend and concentrate on them. Still, it is not too late, I am working on them.
