            1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new  students? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        My advice to new students regarding transitioning to UCU life and culture is to first take everything easy and always try to ask questions from other students who came before you. Don’t get stuck on something and try to think it out on your own, always reach out.
       </P>

            2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        I  think every new WUSC student should do their own research  and try to seek academic advice on what program they should enroll in so that they avoid the mistake of wasting time on a program that they would later switch out of. And when thinking of academic programs that one should get into, one should think of the future i.e what job opportunities are there for graduates of that program.

            3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        For this question, I think one of the best ways to avoid loneliness is to go out there and make friends or make yourself busy with sports like soccer or going to the gym.

            4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms).  
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        I think to succeed in UCU you need a lot of resilience and try to focus on what you really want to achieve in the long run

            5.  Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage expectations from friends and family back home?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        I know when we come to Campus our families and friends back home expect a lot from us and when you think you are not meeting those expectations you can easily get depressed. So my advice to new students on this matter is that not to put a lot of pressure on themselves, just try to do the little that you can.

            6. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
           </p>

        <P>Dream in progress….[yes/no J] </P> 

       <P>I would definitely focus on networking (I should have started ASAP). It opens one up to more opportunities and set oneself up for future success. People don’t bite, talk to more people, especially the ones in your area of interest i.e your profs, industry experts, senior students etc.</P>

        <P>Knowing school as a safe environment that it is, I’d have invested a lil bit of Mulla $$$ in the stock market (4-5yrs is a good time for growth). Own some shares in Tech and Healthcare or whatever pays much. Lastly, I’d be more intentional with things I spend my time on and be more pro-active than ever [Certain energy is required to get thing done!]</P>
