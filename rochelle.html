            1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        Transitioning for me was very simple, I joined one of the churches around UCU and through the church I started attending events. One of the events was camping, and by doing that I started to learn a lot about UCU culture and more. To be brief, what I would like to tell new students is to choose where they will enjoy the most, it can be a church, a club or some other social group. You will make new friends and learn enough about the UCU way of life to successfully cope with the culture shock.

            2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        My advice to new students is to do more research on the job market of whatever degree they want to pursue. It is tough to graduate and realize that chances of getting jobs related to your program are low and going back to school might be too late and out of reach. This is mainly because you will likely have responsibilities by the time you graduate -  time and financial commitments.

            3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        This is a tough question. For me, I was lucky because I was placed in the same University course with my Gayaza OGs. We became friends and used to meet every time when we were on residence and in class. Loneliness was therefore not my problem. My advice to new students is first if you are lucky to be place in the same University with somebody please maintain good relationships and avoid unnecessary competition. Secondly, make friends with other students who came ahead of you. They have experience and they will show you the way, assuming they are good people. Be cautious with who you let into your personal life, some may be bad influencers.

            4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms).  
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        For me, I would say work hard and maintain your sight on what brought you to UCU. Focus on your studies avoid any distracting activities. Build and maintain good relationships with people no matter how they treat you. Be open minded and avoid being too judgmental. Limit involvement in back-home politics because they add more unnecessary stress to your already busy life. Lastly, chase your own goals without comparing yourself to your colleagues who may or many not have better circumstances. God has a plan for you.

            5. What challenges do you think hinder new students from succeeding in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>
        Not making a decision on a career on a program of study early enough. Most of us graduate after jumping from one program to another which is a waste of time. If you don’t carefully pick your program of study early and start planning or doing what it takes to get a job in your field after graduation, you can easily end up jobless for a couple of years but with other burdens to shoulder. Stick to whatever you chose in the first place and graduate in a timely manner. When you waste time in school and later on you don’t land a job using the degree you thought would give you a desirable job, you could end up depressed and anxious about your future. This could be the beginning of all your problems because your brain is everything. Without the right mental health, your productivity declines and you can not accomplish anything.

            6.  Do you have any ideas on how new students can manage expectations from friends and family back home?­­
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>
        Be honest with your family or other relatives. It is tough here, so they need to lower their expectations from you.

            7. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
           </p>

       <P>
        Career-wise, yes. I am happy with what I did.
