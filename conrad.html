            1. From your experience transitioning to UCU life and culture, do you have any advice for new students?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>Just like when you’re introduced to a new concept or topic in class- say organic chemistry for example, moving to UCU feels the same. Everything is strange in the beginning. Sometimes even hard from the word go, and other times, you wonder why and how you signed up for  that class. Others around you might seem to be getting it except you. Transitioning here will feel this way at first. Where do you start? How do you start? You have to start either way.</p>
       <P>Good thing is, it always gets better as you progress. Maybe not easier but better. You are in control of making things better for yourself; don’t be afraid to put yourself out there; ask when in doubt, seek help all the time- you need it much more than you can imagine. There are people who’ll always be there to lend a helping hand. That’s how you learn. That’s how we all learn. By asking, researching, exploring! One more thing- you don’t have to change who you are in order to fit in. Remember that.</P>
       <strong>
           <p>
            2. Do you have any advice on choosing academic programs and careers for later success after school? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>First off; Don’t be afraid of FAILURE. Failure holds us back from literally doing anything. Whatever it is you applied for, give it a shot. Try one more time if the first doesn’t work. It’s okay to fail the first time or the second or the third. </p>

       <p>That said, being in first year can be the most confusing part of university (at least it was for me). If you’re in a limbo of trying to find your interests, be open minded and flexible in your first year. Don’t limit yourself. Try different things to help steer you towards your interests. If you’re set and know what you want to do, seek further guidance from upper year students in the same program.  The school offers academic advice, book appointments for that as well-it can go a long way. Make sure you get as much guidance as possible from those already familiar with the school system. </p>

       <p>In the end, make sure you choose what you like, not what you’ve been conditioned to think is good for you.</p>

       <p>And in my opinion, doing what you love, will determine your ultimate success in the career path you choose. You can be anything you want. You first have to love that which you want to become. That way you’ll give your all and be your best. And that is success.</p>

            3. How can new students cope with loneliness and feeling out of place when they first arrive in UCU? 
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>Making friends can be easy or hard depending on our personalities. However, with University life, you may have to put yourself out there and be ready to approach other students. You will need people around you, especially when adjusting to the new environment. </P>

       <P>Do that during orientation week. Say hi to the person sitting next you in class and ask if you can be friends. Say hi to the one living next door in your residence, or your suite mate.  Sit next to someone in the dining hall and start a conversation with them. Create connections. It will help you to be comfortable as you’ll start to feel less out of place.</P>

            4. From your experience, what does it take to succeed in UCU? (Measuring success in academic and professional terms).  
           </p>
       </strong>
       <P>Building a network. It can start with the local committee you engage with. Then it proceeds to friends you make on campus and the first job you get and so forth. </P>

       <P>That said, be all rounded; engage in extracurricular activities aside from schoolwork. Apply to that work study, join that club, play that sport, apply for that on campus job, volunteer, assist your Prof with their research, engage yourself. Be active. This is how you gain experience and expand on your knowledge outside of books. You learn about actual Campus life and how things are done out there. You will need that experience when applying to graduate school or when you get in the job market later on.</P>

            5. If you can reflect on your personal journey, were your aspirations met? What would you do differently if you were to start over again in UCU?
           </p>
       </strong>
       <p>My journey is an exciting one-one full of optimism. I had no idea I was capable of doing as much as I have done so far. I can only imagine the things I’m yet to achieve! I like to take each day as a learning experience from me. I appreciate and I’m grateful for the good and successful moments in my life and learn through the “I’ve hit rock bottom”, hard ones. </p>

       <p>Having reflected on this question for a while, I realized that If I were to start over again, I wouldn’t have done things differently. Looking back, I think I gave my all for the most part, and would do the same, given another chance. Give it your all friends!</p>
