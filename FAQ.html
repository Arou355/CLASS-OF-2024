        <strong><p>Why CLASS OF '24</p></strong>
          <P>.This is my
              attempt to shine a light on UCU computing class of 2024 on what successful life entails in regard to post-secondary
              education.

          <strong><p>Why profile everybody when we can easily access the 
              information through them and their respective social media handles?
          </p></strong>
          <p>we live in far-flung corners across Africa
              and most didn't know of each other's existence, let alone their academic accident in UCU
              and their professional expertise.This Linkedin-like platform recconcets us.
              Through this we become aware of who is who and what it means to be them.
